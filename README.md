# README

This project contains the implementation of CritMat, which is based on the paper: https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~yzhang/papers/critmat-dsn05.pdf

The main simuator is in test.py. In order to run it, you will need to clone the following dependencies:

1) https://github.com/minyee/facebook_dcn_traffic
2) https://github.com/minyee/robust_topology_engineering

Please make sure that you are cloning these two dependencies and CritMat into the same base directory. This is important for the simulator to run smoothly. For instance, all three projects must have the same base directory called <BASE DIR>/
